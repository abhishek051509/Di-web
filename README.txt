HOSTING INSTRUCTIONS
====================

If you are seeing an error after uploading, it is likely due to how the files are folder structured in the zip.

OPTION 1: Netlify / Vercel (Recommended)
----------------------------------------
1. Unzip this file on your computer.
2. You should see a folder containing 'index.html', 'about.html', 'css' folder, etc.
3. Drag and drop that ENTIRE FOLDER into Netlify Drop or Vercel.

OPTION 2: Uploading to GitHub
-----------------------------
1. Create a new repository.
2. Click "Upload files".
3. Drag all the *extracted* files (index.html, css folder, etc.) - NOT the zip file itself - into the upload area.
4. Commit changes.
5. Go to Settings > Pages > Select 'main' branch > Save.

COMMON ERRORS
-------------
- "404 Not Found": Ensure 'index.html' is in the main folder, not inside a sub-folder.
- "Broken Styles": Ensure the 'css' folder is uploaded alongside the HTML files.

If you still face issues, please tell me the exact error message!
